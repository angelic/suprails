Suprails
========

This project is intended to be a replacement for the "rails" command. It 
does not replace the rails framework but rather provides a starting point
for a rails application far beyond what the "rails" command provides. 
During execution, in fact, the suprails command calls the rails command.

How it works
============

Suprails is unlike most other "Rails plus other stuff" projects out there.
Instead of me, the Suprails author, deciding what you should have in your rails
app, you get to decide. In addition, any time you execute Suprails, you have
the option to update any gems that would otherwise be out-of-date.

Example configuration file (~/.suprails/config)
===============================================

# Notice that ruby comments work just fine!
# gems.update "rspec", "rails", "rspec-rails", "haml", "capistrano"
frozen_rails
gems.config :haml
gems.unpack
plugin "git://github.com/rails/exception_notification"
generate :rspec
folder "public/stylesheets/sass"
delete "public/index.html"
gpl
git
haml

Installation
============

$ sudo gem install listrophy-suprails --source http://gems.github.com

Execution
============

First, run suprails without any arguments:

$ suprails

This will initialize your ~/.suprails/ folder and configuration in that folder

You will now want to edit the configuration file to your liking. It is located
at: ~/.suprails/config

Now, run suprails instead of rails:

$ suprails AppName

History/Bugs
====

0.1.1 - Added the runcommand verb

0.1 - The DB commands do not yet work. You have to just use the file command
      instead.

0.0.0 - Initial readme. No code.
