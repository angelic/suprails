Suprails
========

This project is intended to be a replacement for the "rails" command and
nothing else. It does not replace the rails framework but rather provides a
starting point for a rails application far beyond what the "rails" command
provides. During execution, in fact, the suprails command calls the rails
command.

How it works
============

Suprails is unlike most other "Rails plus other stuff" projects out there.
Instead of me, the Suprails author, decided what you should have in your rails
app, you get to decide. In addiiton, any time you execute Suprails, you have
the option to update any gems that would otherwise be out-of-date.

Installation
